            <p><strong>What is Phishing?</strong></p>
            <p>
              Phishing is a type of online scam where cybercriminals pretend to be 
              trusted people or companies (like your bank, a delivery service, or even your boss) 
              to trick you into sharing private information. This information can include 
              things like your usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or even personal 
              details such as your date of birth or address. 
            </p>
            <p>
              These attackers usually reach out to you through emails, text messages, 
              phone calls, or even fake websites that look very real. Their main goal 
              is to steal your information so they can use it for things like stealing 
              your money, hacking into your accounts, or committing identity theft.
            </p>
          
            <p><strong>How to Recognize a Phishing Attempt:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Strange email addresses:</strong> The sender’s address may look 
                  similar to a real one, but it usually has extra numbers, letters, or 
                  spelling mistakes (for example: support@paypa1.com instead of paypal.com).</li>
              <li><strong>Scary or urgent messages:</strong> The message may say things like 
                  “Your account will be locked today!” or “Act now to avoid losing access.” 
                  This is to make you panic and click without thinking.</li>
              <li><strong>Requests for personal details:</strong> No real company will ask 
                  you to send your password, PIN, or credit card number through email or text.</li>
              <li><strong>Suspicious links:</strong> The email may ask you to click a link 
                  that looks official but actually takes you to a fake website. When you 
                  hover your mouse over the link (without clicking), you may notice the 
                  web address looks unusual or misspelled.</li>
              <li><strong>Attachments you weren’t expecting:</strong> A random file may 
                  contain malware (harmful software) if you download and open it.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p><strong>How to Protect Yourself:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Think before you click:</strong> Never click on links or 
                  download files from suspicious emails or messages.</li>
              <li><strong>Double-check the sender:</strong> Look carefully at the email 
                  address or phone number. If something feels off, contact the company 
                  directly using their official website or phone number.</li>
              <li><strong>Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> This adds an 
                  extra step when logging into your accounts (like entering a code sent 
                  to your phone). Even if a hacker gets your password, they still can’t 
                  get in easily.</li>
              <li><strong>Keep your software updated:</strong> Make sure your phone, 
                  computer, and apps always have the latest security updates installed.</li>
              <li><strong>Report phishing attempts:</strong> If you receive a suspicious 
                  message, report it to the company being impersonated and delete it. 
                  Most email services also let you mark the message as "Phishing".</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p><b>
              Remember: if a message seems unusual, too good to be true, or tries to 
              scare you into acting fast, i'’s probably a phishing attempt.
            </b></p>

              <p><strong>What is Ransomware?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Ransomware is a type of harmful software (malware) that locks you out of your 
                computer or files. Once your files are locked, you can’t open or use them 
                without a special "key." The criminals behind the attack then demand that 
                you pay them money (called a <em>ransom</em>) to get the key and unlock your files. 
              </p>
              <p>
                These payments are usually asked for in cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) 
                so they can’t be traced easily. Even if you pay, there’s no guarantee 
                the attackers will actually unlock your files — many victims pay and 
                never get their data back.
              </p>
          
              <p><strong>How to Recognize a Ransomware Attack:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Sudden inability to access files:</strong> Files that were 
                    working fine before may suddenly show errors, be renamed with 
                    strange extensions (like <code>.locked</code>), or become completely 
                    unreadable.</li>
                <li><strong>A ransom note appears:</strong> A pop-up message or a 
                    text/HTML file may appear on your screen telling you your files are 
                    locked. It usually demands payment and gives instructions on how to pay.</li>
                <li><strong>Threats to scare you:</strong> The message may say your 
                    files will be deleted, published online, or made permanentely 
                    inaccessible if you don’t pay within a short time limit.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer running strangely:</strong> Your system may slow down, 
                    crash, or show unusual error messages after the infection.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p><strong>How to Protect Yourself from Ransomware:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Back up your files regularly:</strong> Keep copies of your 
                    important data on an external drive or cloud service. If your 
                    computer is infected, you can restore your files from the backup.</li>
                <li><strong>Update your software:</strong> Make sure your operating 
                    system, apps, and antivirus software are always up to date. Updates 
                    often fix security holes that attackers try to exploit.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid suspicious downloads:</strong> Don’t download files 
                    from unknown websites or click links in random emails. These are 
                    common ways ransomware spreads.</li>
                <li><strong>Be careful with email attachments:</strong> Even if the 
                    email looks like it’s from someone you know, double-check before 
                    opening attachments — especially if you weren’t expecting them.</li>
                <li><strong>Use trusted security software:</strong> A good antivirus 
                    or anti-malware program can detect and block ransomware before 
                    it can do damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Think twice before enabling macros:</strong> Some ransomware 
                    hides in Word or Excel documents that ask you to "enable macros." 
                    Never do this unless you’re 100% sure the file is safe.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>
                Remember: once ransomware locks your files, recovering them is very hard. 
                Prevention is the best protection — stay alert and back up your data often.
              </p>

              <p><strong>What is Malware?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Malware (short for <em>malicious software</em>) is any type of harmful 
                program created to damage, steal from, or take control of your computer, 
                phone, or network. Unlike normal software that helps you, malware is made 
                to harm you or your device. 
              </p>
              <p>
                There are many different types of malware, such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Programs that spread by attaching 
                    themselves to files and can damage or delete data.</li>
                <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Malware that spreads on its own through 
                    networks without needing you to click anything.</li>
                <li><strong>Trojans:</strong> Programs that pretend to be safe or 
                    useful but secretly cause harm once installed.</li>
                <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Software that secretly monitors your 
                    activity and sends your personal data to hackers.</li>
                <li><strong>Adware:</strong> Unwanted programs that flood your device 
                    with pop-up ads, often slowing it down.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A type of malware that locks your files 
                    and demands payment to unlock them.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p><strong>How to Recognize a Malware Infection:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Slower performance:</strong> Your computer or phone suddenly 
                    becomes much slower than usual.</li>
                <li><strong>Unexpected pop-ups or ads:</strong> You see lots of strange 
                    messages or ads, even when you aren’t browsing the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Programs behaving oddly:</strong> Apps might open, close, 
                    or crash without you doing anything.</li>
                <li><strong>Unauthorized access:</strong> Files may disappear, 
                    move around, or be changed without your knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Strange network activity:</strong> Your internet might feel 
                    unusually busy even when you aren’t using it, as malware may be 
                    sending information in the background.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery draining fast (for phones):</strong> Malware running 
                    secretly can use up your phone’s battery much faster than normal.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p><strong>How to Protect Yourself from Malware:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Use trusted antivirus software:</strong> A good security 
                    program can detect and remove malware before it causes serious damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep your system updated:</strong> Regular updates fix 
                    weaknesses in your operating system and apps that hackers might exploit.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid suspicious links and downloads:</strong> Don’t click 
                    unknown links or download files from emails, texts, or websites 
                    you don’t trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Be careful with free software:</strong> Some “free” apps 
                    can come bundled with hidden malware. Only download from official 
                    app stores or trusted sites.</li>
                <li><strong>Check before plugging in USB drives:</strong> Hackers can 
                    use infected USB drives to spread malware to your computer.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a firewall:</strong> Firewalls help block unauthorized 
                    access to your system over the internet.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>
                Remember: Malware can sneak onto your device without you even noticing. 
                Staying cautious and keeping your software updated is the best defense.
              </p>

                Social engineering is a trick used by cybercriminals to get you to 
                share private or sensitive information. Instead of breaking into 
                your computer with software, they try to <em>manipulate you as a person</em> 
                into giving them access. They often pretend to be someone you trust, 
                such as a bank worker, a company employee, or even a friend, to get 
                you to reveal details like your passwords, banking information, or 
                personal data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Social engineering attacks can happen through emails, phone calls, 
                text messages, or even in person. The attackers rely on human 
                emotions like fear, trust, urgency, or curiosity to trick you.
              </p>
          
              <p><strong>Common Examples of Social Engineering:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Phishing emails:</strong> Fake emails that look like 
                    they’re from a real company asking you to “confirm” your account 
                    details.</li>
                <li><strong>Pretexting:</strong> When someone creates a fake story 
                    (or “pretext”) to get you to share information — for example, 
                    pretending to be IT support asking for your login to “fix an issue.”</li>
                <li><strong>Baiting:</strong> Offering something tempting, like a free 
                    download or USB drive, that actually contains malware.</li>
                <li><strong>Tailgating (or Piggybacking):</strong> Physically following 
                    someone into a secure building by pretending to be an employee 
                    who forgot their badge.</li>
                <li><strong>Vishing (Voice Phishing):</strong> Phone calls from scammers 
                    pretending to be from your bank or a government agency, trying to 
                    make you give personal information.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p><strong>How to Recognize a Social Engineering Attack:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Unusual requests:</strong> Someone asks for sensitive 
                    information (like passwords or account details) that they normally 
                    wouldn’t need.</li>
                <li><strong>Pressure to act quickly:</strong> The attacker tries to 
                    rush you, saying things like “Your account will be closed today 
                    if you don’t act now.”</li>
                <li><strong>Impersonation of authority figures:</strong> They may 
                    pretend to be a boss, police officer, or bank representative to 
                    gain your trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Too good to be true offers:</strong> Promises of free 
                    money, prizes, or gifts are usually scams.</li>
                <li><strong>Requests to keep it secret:</strong> If someone tells you 
                    “Don’t tell anyone about this,” it’s a red flag.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p><strong>How to Protect Yourself from Social Engineering:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Be skeptical of unsolicited requests:</strong> If someone 
                    contacts you out of the blue asking for private details, don’t 
                    trust it right away.</li>
                <li><strong>Verify identities:</strong> Call the company or person 
                    directly using a phone number or website you know is real — 
                    not the one given in the suspicious message.</li>
                <li><strong>Never share sensitive info without confirmation:</strong> 
                    Don’t give out passwords, PINs, or financial details unless you 
                    are 100% sure the request is genuine.</li>
                <li><strong>Take your time:</strong> Don’t let anyone rush you. 
                    Scammers want you to act before thinking carefully.</li>
                <li><strong>Educate yourself and others:</strong> The more you know 
                    about social engineering tactics, the less likely you are to fall 
                    for them.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>
                Remember: Social engineering attacks target <em>people</em>, not just 
                computers. Stay alert, trust your instincts, and always double-check 
                before sharing personal information.

              <span class="feature-title">Wi-Fi Risks</span>
              <span class="feature-arrow">&#x25BC;</span>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-content">
              <p><strong>What are Wi-Fi Risks?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Using public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks (like the free Wi-Fi in 
                airports, cafes, hotels, or shopping malls) can put your personal 
                information at risk. These networks are often open for anyone to join, 
                which means attackers can secretly watch what you’re doing online.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Cybercriminals can use these networks to steal your passwords, read 
                your messages, spy on the websites you visit, or even take control of 
                your accounts. Because public Wi-Fi doesn’t always use strong 
                encryption, your data may travel across the network in a way that 
               ’s easy to intercept.
              </p>
          
              <p><strong>How Attackers Exploit Public Wi-Fi:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:</strong> Hackers place 
                    themselves between you and the internet, secretly copying the 
                    information you send and receive.</li>
                <li><strong>Fake Wi-Fi Hotspots:</strong> Attackers create a 
                    Wi-Fi network with a name that looks legitimate 
                    (like “Free_Airport_WiFi”) to trick you into connecting.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Sniffing:</strong> Without proper encryption, 
                    hackers can monitor your online activity and steal login 
                    details, credit card numbers, or private messages.</li>
                <li><strong>Session Hijacking:</strong> Once you log in to a website, 
                    attackers can hijack your session and access your account as if 
                    they were you.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p><strong>How to Recognize Risky Wi-Fi Networks:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>No password required:</strong> Networks that don’t ask 
                    for a password are usually unsafe.</li>
                <li><strong>Unfamiliar or suspicious names:</strong> Be cautious 
                    if you see networks with strange or misspelled names 
                    (e.g., “Sturbucks_FreeWiFi” instead of “Starbucks WiFi”).</li>
                <li><strong>Security warning messages:</strong> If your device warns 
                    that the connection isn’t secure, don’t ignore it.</li>
                <li><strong>Too good to be true:</strong> A network that suddenly 
                    offers fast, free Wi-Fi everywhere may not be trustworthy.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p><strong>How to Protect Yourself from Wi-Fi Risks:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Avoid doing sensitive tasks on public Wi-Fi:</strong> 
                    Don’t log in to your bank, shop online, or access private 
                    accounts when using open Wi-Fi.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network):</strong> A VPN 
                    encrypts your internet connection so hackers can’t easily 
                    see what you’re doing.</li>
                <li><strong>Connect only to trusted networks:</strong> Whenever 
                    possible, use mobile data or secure Wi-Fi you know belongs 
                    to the place you’re in.</li>
                <li><strong>Forget networks after use:</strong> Set your device 
                    so it doesn’t automatically reconnect to Wi-Fi networks 
                    without your permission.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep your device updated:</strong> Updates often 
                    include security fixes that protect you from Wi-Fi attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Turn off sharing:</strong> Disable features like 
                    file sharing, printer sharing, and AirDrop when on public Wi-Fi.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>
                Remember: Free Wi-Fi is convenient, but it comes with risks. Always 
                think twice before connecting, and use extra protection like a VPN 
                if you need to use it.
              </p>

              <p><strong>What is Data Privacy & GDPR?</strong></p>
              <p>
                <strong>Data Privacy</strong> is about protecting your personal information 
                — things like your name, email address, phone number, home address, 
                photos, and even your online activity. Protecting your privacy means 
                making sure your information is not collected, shared, or used without 
                your knowledge or permission.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</strong> is a law in the 
                European Union (EU) designed to give people more control over their personal 
                data. Even if you don’t live in the EU, many companies around the world 
                follow GDPR rules, so it can still benefit you. GDPR makes it clear that 
                <em>your data belongs to you</em>, and you have the right to know how 
                it’s collected, stored, and used.
              </p>
          
              <p><strong>Why Data Privacy Matters:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Prevents identity theft:</strong> If your private info is stolen, 
                    criminals could open bank accounts, credit cards, or loans in your name.</li>
                <li><strong>Protects your money:</strong> Hackers can use stolen data to 
                    access your bank accounts or shop online without your permission.</li>
                <li><strong>Keeps your online life private:</strong> Companies and hackers 
                    shouldn’t be able to track your every move without your consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoids unwanted spam and scams:</strong> Sharing too much 
                    data can lead to endless spam emails, calls, and targeted scams.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p><strong>Your Rights Under GDPR:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to know:</strong> You can ask companies what data 
                    they have about you.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to consent:</strong> Companies must ask for your 
                    permission before collecting or using your data.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to access:</strong> You can request a copy of the 
                    personal data a company has stored about you.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to delete:</strong> You can ask for your data to 
                    be erased (“right to be forgotten”).</li>
                <li><strong>Right to correct:</strong> If your information is wrong, 
                    you can have it fixed.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to limit or refuse:</strong> You can say no to 
                    certain ways companies use your data, like for marketing.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p><strong>How to Recognize GDPR in Action:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent requests:</strong> Websites asking you to accept 
                    or reject cookies before browsing.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy policy updates:</strong> Emails or pop-ups from 
                    services explaining how your data is handled.</li>
                <li><strong>Options to manage your data:</strong> Settings in your 
                    account that let you download, delete, or change your personal 
                    information.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p><strong>How to Protect Your Data Privacy:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Read privacy policies:</strong> Before using a website or 
                    app, check how your data will be collected and used.</li>
                <li><strong>Use privacy settings:</strong> Adjust the privacy options 
                    on social media, apps, and devices to control who can see your 
                    information.</li>
                <li><strong>Be careful with what you share:</strong> Don’t post 
                    sensitive details like your address, phone number, or travel plans 
                    on public platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise your rights:</strong> If a company misuses your 
                    data, request corrections or deletion using your GDPR rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Use strong security practices:</strong> Protect your 
                    accounts with strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and 
                    up-to-date software.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>
                Remember: Your personal data is valuable. Treat it like money — only 
                share it with trusted companies and always make sure you’re in control 
                of how it’s used.
